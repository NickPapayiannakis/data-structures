OVERVIEW: CONTAINS
DESCRIPTION: accepts a callback and executes it on every value contained in the tree.

1. We need to determine if a tree exists
2.If it does, we invoke the call back on the tree's value
3.Also, if the tree has a left child, invoke the callback on the left
4.If the tree has a child on the right, invoke the callback on the right

TEST: should execute a callback on every value in a tree using "depthFirstLog"

BinarySearchTree.prototype.contains = function(target){

  };

PSEUDO-CODE:

//if this.value is not equal to null
  //invoke call back with this.value
//if this.left is not equal to null
  //call the depthFirstLog recursively on this.left
//if this.right is not equal to null
  //call the depthFirstLog recursively on this.right
